I am grateful to...
\newline
My circle of friends and peers throughout University for keeping the support and discussions of content and morale boosts across the years.
\newline
My lecturers from each year within University to helping me learn and understand the concepts and practices of software development and the lifecycle of development projects that helped me through the project.
\newline
The University as a whole, for providing an excellent Computer Science department and degree scheme with which I could study in a beautiful town.

I'd like to specifically thank...
\newline
My supervisor, Amanda Clare, for being my guidance throughout the major project and helped answer many of my basic and silly domain and process questions, and keeping me on track for completing a body of work.
\newline
Sam Nicholls, who spent a number of hours with me at the beginning of the project to help me understand what it was I was actually trying to undertake, and gave some solid advice about working through a major project module.
\newline
Alex Jollands and Sion Griffiths, who throughout University, and in particular the major project, have been an invaluable resource and support, and have been some of the best friends at University I could have asked for.
\newline
Finally to my house mate and partner throughout University, Sapphire Fairhurst, who provided the best support, friendship and care that I'm not sure how I would have been without her.
