The project topic outlines the issue that there is a need for toolkits to report on the quality of metagenome assembly data, and that one such tool could be created for this project as a software engineering issue. The report looks into creating the tool `Khimeta' that attempted to meet this problem, the background research done to prepare for it, issues and interesting points during implementation, expectations, testing of the application, the lifecycle model of development and an evalutation of the process and development of the application after completion.
