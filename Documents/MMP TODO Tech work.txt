MAYBE CORE
1. New display for drastic changing in GC Content % - e.g. Half and Half species contig. Easy to see, but to detect in code?
2. Dirty k-mer analysis in code, even if not displayed.
Hosting requirements
Data upload limit

x -Self-created FASTA files - Completely artifical to test GC / ORF examples, and actual data of 3-5 species mixed together
	this is to help see if we end up with some results like "Ah, mixed species" or not
x -Label Superframe (comparisson)
x -Make SUPER FRAME comparisson for GC and ORF location (use yellow for highlighting).
x -Sort list of contigs for Length using Comparable and collection.Sort()
x -ORF Location list down the side of the page
x -ORF Location information of highlighted ORF
x -Use Tabs for displaying the GC, ORF and Superframe comparisson.
x -Loading Button when loading contig inspection
x -Flip reverse frames
x -ORF Location labelling - Colour the highlighted one when info displayed
x -Move JS into JS files with includes
x -Parameters on List page when clicking 'Inspect', not on submission page
x -ORF Location fix (Doesn't match 100%s...)

NICE TO HAVE
Reformat ORF Location context data into tables with <td> rather than paragraphs and spaces. Ensures line is always equal
Gracefully handle errors
Submitting files not just pasting
Validate user input in FASTA box - See guide
Error page with explanation
404 page
'ContigParameters' tie in with CurrentContig - per contig gc size suggestion 
List of contigs that were skipped in QA due to under length threshold - dont need to make Obj, just
	 String name + length and display
Suggest GC Window size to user per contig based on length
